Habitat is a system for tracking high altitude balloons. People with radios
upload telemetry strings to habitat, which parses them and stores them usefully
in a database for later display via a web frontend.

Habitat is currently still early in development.

The GitHub project has up to date code and information:

See also README.md for setup instructions.
