``habitat.loadable_manager``: the loadable-function manager

This manager is given a list of modules to load from the configuration file,
and it loads all of the functions in each module such that they can later be
used by other pieces of habitat code while ensuring that only modules specified
on the command line can be used in such a way; this prevents user-specified
Python code paths being used.

The modules that functions are loaded from are given shorthand names to ease
referring to them from configuration documents et cetera, for example
``habitat.sensors.stdtelem.time`` might become ``stdtelem.time``. The shorthand
is specified in the configuration document.

Sensor Functions
================

One of the major uses of loadable_manager (and historically its only use) is
sensor functions, used by parser modules to convert input data into usable
Python data formats. See :py:mod:`habitat.sensors` for some sensors included
with habitat, but you may also want to write your own for a specific type of
data.

A sensor function may two one or two arguments, *config* and *data* or just
*data*. It can return any Python object which can be stored in the CouchDB
database.

*config* is a dict of options. It is passed to the function from
:py:meth:`LoadableManager.run`

*data* is the string to parse.


Filter Functions
================

Another use for the loadable_manager is filters that are applied against
incoming telemetry strings. Which filters to use is specified in a payload's
flight document, either as user-specified (but signed) hotfix code or a
loadable function name, as with sensors.

See :py:mod:`habitat.filters` for some filters included with habitat.

Filters can take one or two arguments, *config*, *data* or just *data*. They
should return a suitably modified form of data, optionally using anything from
*config* which was specified by the user in the flight document.
