"""
A generic dynamic python module loader.

The main function to call is load(). In addition, several functions
to quickly test the loaded object for certain conditions are provided:

* :func:`isclass`
* :func:`isfunction`
* :func:`isgeneratorfunction`
* :func:`isstandardfunction` (``isfunction and not isgeneratorfunction``)
* :func:`iscallable`
* :func:`issubclass`
* :func:`hasnumargs`
* :func:`hasmethod`
* :func:`hasattr`

Further to that, functions :func:`expectisclass`, :func:`expectisfunction`,
etc., are provided which are identical to the above except they raise either a
ValueError or a TypeError where the original function would have returned
``False``.

Example use::

    def loadsomething(loadable):
        loadable = dynamicloader.load(loadable)
        expectisstandardfunction(loadable)
        expecthasattr(loadable, 2)

If you use :func:`expectiscallable` note that you may get either a function
or a class, an object of which is callable (i.e., the class has
``__call__(self, ...))``. In that case you may need to create an object::

    if isclass(loadable):
        loadable = loadable()

Of course if you've used :func:`expectisclass` then you will be creating an
object anyway. Note that classes are technically "callable" in that calling
them creates objects. :func:`expectiscallable` ignores this.

A lot of the provided tests are imported straight from inspect and are
therefore not documented here. The ones implemented as a part of this
module are.
