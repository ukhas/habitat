``habitat.sensors``: the sensor-function manager

The sensor function manager provides a collection of sensor functions,
which are used by parser modules to turn extracted fields into useful data.

Sensor functions are grouped into "libraries", which are python
modules. When loaded, these modules are assigned a shorthand. For example,
functions in ``habitat.sensors.stdtelem`` are available simply as
``stdtelem.func``. The shorthand assigned is specified in the config document.

These all libraries listed in the Sensor Manager's configuration are loaded
upon initialisation.

Sensor Functions
================

The sensor_manager provides the *base* library built in; it includes

 * ascii_int
 * ascii_float
 * string

Other libraries are available with habitat. See :py:mod:`sensors`

A sensor function takes two arguments, *config* and *data*. It
can return a string, list, dict, int, float, or any other python
object that can be stored in a couchdb database.

*config* is a dict of options. It is passed to the function from
:py:meth:`SensorManager.parse`

*data* is the string to parse.
